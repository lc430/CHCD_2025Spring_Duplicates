# CHCD_2025Spring_Duplicates

## Feb 12 2025 first commit from Lize:
Test from local database
Found 53 duplicate records to process
47 merges completed

### Merge results not completely checked yet
Only checked whether one of the merged notes deleted from the database(âœ…), but its notes remains **null** (not sure whether other columns of info successfully appended). 
(not sure how to restore the neo4j database previous version so...)

### Further things left to do:
check with local database again to make sure the merge function is correct or not? 
if correct, may employ the function to the remote database
if not, debug or further edit the script <3
